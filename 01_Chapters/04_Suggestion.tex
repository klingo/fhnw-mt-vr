\section{Introduction}

The in chapter \ref{DSRCycle} discussed \gls{dsr} cycle from \cite{Vaishnavi2008} and \cite{Hevner2010} defines \textit{Suggestion} as the next step after \textit{Awareness of Problem}. \newline
\cite{Vaishnavi2008} define the \textit{Suggestion} phase as a creative step in which new functionality is envisioned to form a tentative design for the development of the prototype. \cite{Vaishnavi2008} further specifies the output as a constructed theory that addresses the identified problem, which can include new ideas and concepts, new methods, and new models that in the end shall be validated with the development of the prototype. \newline
In a first step, the end goals of the design are defined. Then the individual states of presentation (e.g. an overview and detail view) are defined as well as the navigation between them. As the third step, the visualisation of the individual states are defined before finally the interaction patterns (action/reaction) can be mapped to them.

\section{Conclusion}



%% IDEA FOR PROTOTYPE

- Start with a small table on which a house etc is visualized. floating above is year (+month)
- Each object represents one category from the financial expenses.
- maybe size indicates the overall amount?
- The colours depends on the difference between my planned expenses (or average expenses) and the actual expenses. less = green, about the same = yellow-(green-)ish, slightly above = orange, above = red.
- By clicking on one of the objects, it gets highlighted and a line-chart appears showing the expenses
   A) show individual transactions for the given month up until the threshold
   B) show individual months until the threshold (+forecast?)
- show multiple lines for the different sub-categories (enable/disable) plus the total
- clicking on an entry of the line chart displays details about transaction (amount, location), or the month (amount) in an overlay
- switching between single-month and year view by... using the touchpad (up/down clicks)
- navigating through months/years by... a using the touchpad! (left/right clicks)
- resetting the view to start by... clicking on the select button

- maybe outside as rotating rings: the individual bank accounts?
