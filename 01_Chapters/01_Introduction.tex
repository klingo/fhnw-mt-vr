Technological advancements are of constant nature to us and affect most areas in our lifes. Just twenty years ago, one had to go to a physical branch of a bank to make a simple payment or check the current account balance. Then online banking emerged, soon followed by mobile banking, and the next big advancement might just be waiting ahead of us in the form of \gls{vr}. This master thesis provides an overview of the current state of research regarding the interaction with, and visualisation of, categorized financial data in virtual reality with the intention to make exploratory analysis more simple and to provide better insights into trends and changes.

With the public release of the Oculus Rift in March 2016 \citep{Oculus2016} and the HTC Vive in April 2016 \citep{Htcvive2016}, \gls{vr} has arrived at the consumer level and is all over the news. Although we currently only see the first iteration of consumer products, \cite{Gartner2015} predicts that within the next five to ten years, \gls{vr} will achieve mainstream adoption and enter the so called "Plateau of Productivity". Gesture Control is even a bit ahead of \gls{vr} and its mainstream adoption is already expected in the next two to five years \citep{Gartner2015}. The ways to interact with \glspl{ve} have recently been massively improved with new \glspl{hmd} and input devices such as very accurate gesture controllers or full 360Â° motion tracking, which all are just getting in the focus of research now. Since these big advancements in hardware happened only very recently, the software first has to catch up with all the new possibilities that became available. It is very easy now to create 3D visualisations, but the big questions remains about why we should do that. \cite{Ware2012} sees clear clear advantages in the conventional two-dimensional techniques with bar charts and scatter plots, since the powerful pattern-finding mechanism of our brain also works in 2D. Furthermore, there are well established and effective (2D) data representations that are also very easy to be included in any kind of two-dimensional medium such as a book or a report \citep{Ware2012}. On the other side, \cite{Ware2012} also points out that we live in a three-dimensional word and interact with it so frequently that our brains got very much used to it. It is also important to understand that ultimately a 2D space is part of 3D space and thus any two-dimensional object can always be flattened out and presented as such in 3D space. \cite{Kwon2015} stated that in a 2D environment/space (like a regular screen) it makes sense to use 2D objects for the presentation, whereas in a \gls{vr} environment where the viewing direction can be freely chosen by the user, the whole three-dimensional space should be utilized. It generally can be said that we are only at the beginning of understanding how to effectively use these new means. Chapter \ref{SectionLiteratureReviewSRQ1} and \ref{SectionLiteratureReviewSRQ2} in the literature review will further discuss these possibilities of \gls{vr}.

In recent years we also have seen massive advancements in the functionalities provided by banks to their clients. Contact-less payments and mobile banking are on the rise, and in 2014 UBS AG even won the "Master of Swiss Web" award and two gold medals for their new e-banking platform \citep{UBSAG2014}. But when clients want to look at the financial situation, nothing has changed for a long time in terms of how it is presented to the users: always the same old bar- and pie charts. Figure \ref{fig:ubsspendinganalysis} gives an impression of how categorized financial data is visualized on a 2D screen. These categories help to classify individual transaction into groups such as 'Living \& Energy' or 'Household' for a better understanding. Many challenges and requirements have to be covered nowadays: clients want to immediately see and understand their financial situation, they want to be able to make comparisons and see trends. This exploratory analysis is currently only possible with limitations, also due to the restriction of only two (real) axis that are possible on a 2D display. \cite{Jamieson2007} see that it becomes increasingly difficult to get a meaningful understanding of the big amount of data that is still presented with traditional methods. They continue that these methods will sooner or later come to their limits and new visualisation methods have to be established \citep{Jamieson2007}. Chapter \ref{SectionLiteratureReviewSRQ3} in the literature review addresses the currently researched methods for data visualization in more detail.

The focus of this master thesis is on the new possibilities of visualising and interacting with data about our financial situation in \gls{vr} by utilizing the latest available (consumer) \gls{vr}-hardware and research about data visualisation. The additional three-dimensional space of \gls{vr} can be utilized to make exploratory analysis more intuitive, efficient, and interactive compared to traditional 2D solutions.

In the following sub-chapters, more background information about the topic is given as well as the definition of the problem statement. Based on this, the thesis statement is proposed and research questions are derived from it. Following these, the delineations and limitations are presented before this chapter is closed with the structure of the thesis and a brief overview of the chapters and their correlations.

\section{Background}

\gls{vr} has been around us for a few decades already, but only in the last couple of years with increasingly fast hardware and reduced costs, \gls{vr} made rapid advancements \citep{vrs2015}. Computers and even smartphones are now powerful enough to provide good \gls{vr} experiences. Very dominant at the moment are the entertainment purposes, for which \gls{vr} is currently mainly utilized, but it can also go beyond that and provide profound educational experiences if curated with the right content \citep{Safrudin2015}. \gls{vr} even should be seen as disruptive, as a \textbf{game changer} that can become accessible to everyone and will be very promising for high-tech enterprises that focus on retail and banking \citep{Safrudin2015}. \newline
Every year, Gartner publishes their hype cycle on different topics, including the \textit{Emerging Technology Hype Cycle} from 2015 (Figure \ref{fig:hypecycle}). This shows that \gls{vr} has the phase of over-excitement and unrealistic expectations already behind it and is close to the point where it is widely understood by the general public. A bit further than \gls{vr} itself is Gesture Control that according to \cite{Gartner2015} will already reach mainstream adoption in the next two to five years.

\end{figure} \newline
There are different interaction methods (i.e. devices to interact with the \gls{ve}) that each provide advantages and disadvantages in the execution of tasks belonging to one of three groups of interaction patterns: \textit{Travel}, \textit{Selection} and \textit{Manipulation} \citep{Bowman2002}.

\section{Problem Statement}

Over the last two decades, the personal banking area underwent some major technical advancements that went from branch-only interactions over e-banking to mobile banking that can be used anytime, anywhere. But there were only minor advancements in terms of how information about the financial situation is presented to the user. The focus still heavily lies on the (limited) 2D space for displaying the same old pie charts and tables that are known for over a decade now. Their interaction possibilities are quite limited and with all the single-page applications, comparisons of different date-ranges or categories of expenses are very difficult to make and new trends are hard to identify. These problems are challenged with the introduction of \gls{vr} for exploratory analysis of categorized financial data. With the additional (virtual) space of \gls{vr}, multiple views can be displayed simultaneously and new possibilities for data interaction can be made available to the user.

	\textit{\mrqtext}
\end{framed} \label{MRQ}
From the \gls{mrq}, the \glspl{srq} can be derived and are defined as follows:
\begin{framed}
	\textit{\gls{srq} 1: \srqonetext}
\end{framed} \label{SRQ1}
\begin{framed}
	\textit{\gls{srq} 2: \srqtwotext}
\end{framed} \label{SRQ2}

 \begin{framed}
 	\textit{\gls{srq} 4: \srqfourtext}
 \end{framed} \label{SRQ4}
The first three \glspl{srq} are answered as part of the literature review, whereas for \gls{srq} 4 an answer is proposed as part of the design suggestion and then validated with the implementation and evaluation of the artefact.

\section{Research Objective}

The research objective of this master thesis is to define how visualisation and interaction with categorized financial data in virtual reality can look like in order to enhance the exploratory analysis of it, compared to traditional approaches. \newline
This objective will be addressed by first conducting a literature review on the research that has already bee done in the fields of input methods and interaction patterns, as well as data visualisation. Based on this, a dedicated approach for the visualisation and the corresponding interaction patterns will be defined and applied in a prototype application. This also acts as a verification that the visualisation approach and interaction patterns indeed are feasible. Finally, the prototype will be evaluated with a set of real-world scenarios that require an exploratory analysis of a set of categorized financial data as shown in Appendix \ref{AppendixA}.



TODO: IMPLEMENT THIS TEXT
The anonymized base data set of categorized financial data is shown in Appendix \ref{AppendixA} and contains detailed information about financial transactions of a single year. Not only does it contain data about the date, the currency and amount, or the recipient but every single transaction is also categorized in: \textit{Main category} and \textit{Subcategory}. A complete overview and mapping of these categories is shown below in Table \ref{tbl:financialcategories}.

\section{Delineations and Limitations}

In this thesis, the focus lies on publicly available consumer \gls{vr} hardware and no own display or input devices will be designed or built. The data-set used for this thesis is a static set of anonymized financial transactions with no option for live-feed data updates. Furthermore, the topic of data security is completely neglected for the design and implementation of the artefact. The focus of the suggested design and inherently the implemented artefact is more on the technical feasibility and the functionality than on the the psychological aspects of usability, user experience, or productivity measurements.
