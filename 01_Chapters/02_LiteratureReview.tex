\section{Different Methods for User Input in Virtual Reality}

\label{SectionLiteratureReviewSRQ1}

This chapter deals with the first SRQ, focusing on the currently used and researched different methods for user input in virtual reality. It starts with an introduction and an overview of the different methods while the subsequent chapters give more details on the individual methods.

\subsection{Introduction}

\gls{hci} itself has been worked and research on approximately from the 1950s onwards, where the main focus was on the direct manipulation of graphical objects with the mouse as well as gesture recognition \citep{Myers1998}. During this time however, gesture recognition was rather understood as devices that work with pen-based input devices and thus can recognize patterns that are drawn with these pens \citep{Myers1998}. In the regular interaction between human and machines these methods for user input are still fairly sufficient as even today we are still fully relying on having a mouse/track-pad/touch-screen and a keyboard to interact with our computers. \newline
Virtual reality changes this since quite a bit since wearing a \gls{hmd} with its own display obstructs the view on the so far used physical input devices. New solutions had to be found for this changed situation. An overview on the researched interaction patterns with virtual reality is shown in the following sub-chapter

\subsection{Overview}

The reviewed literature brought up different means in research to interact with the virtual reality environment. In order to review them in a more structured way, they have been grouped based on their core technology (i.e. hand gestures, speech recognition etc.) on which they base on. The regular game controllers have been excluded in this research since they basically are not much different from mouse and keyboard as they do not provide any added interaction functionality.


\subsubsection{Hand Gestures}

\label{SubSubSectionHandGestures}

The by far most utilized and researched interaction method is hand gestures. Since we also heavily rely on this interaction pattern in real life with other human beings, it is fair to assume that the familiarity of it helps the research in a significant way whereas methods that rely on physical hardware often feel more distant. \newline
\cite{Pfeiffer2008} conducted an empirical study about conversational pointing gestures in virtual reality interaction where the focus lied on the system to recognize on which object the user was pointing at. \cite{Pfeiffer2008} distinguished between \gls{ifp} where the direction of where the index finger is pointing at, and \gls{gfp} where an imaginary line between the viewers eye and the tip of the index finger is drawn. Provided the objects are nod too close to each other (>20cm), both methods had equal accuracy and success while tracked with two cameras from different angles and motion capturing \citep{Pfeiffer2008}. Figure \ref{fig:pointinggesture} shows the application of this in an identification game which was part of the empirical study.
\begin{figure}[h]

		\label{fig:pointinggesture}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\newline
A similar approach has been research by \cite{Rautaray2011} who used a single camera with an application that did the image capturing, locating the hand and its orientation and finally model the gesture to find a match for predefined gestures. The focus relied on simple gestures for \textit{punch} (three fingers), \textit{grab} (fist), \textit{throw} (five fingers), and to \textit{move forward} (thumb up) within a simple VR game \citep{Rautaray2011}. The recognition rate was between 80\% and 94\% (depending on the gesture), which might not be accurate enough for practical use cases as also acknowledged by \cite{Rautaray2011}. \newline
In a more recent study of \cite{Khundam2015}, it was not cameras that were used to track the hand gestures but a Leap Motion (an in-air controller) attached to the front of an Oculus Rift. Figure \ref{fig:leapmotion} shows the different gestures that were implemented by \cite{Khundam2015} in order to navigate within a virtual environment. Depending on how far the hand is moved towards a certain angle, the speed of the movement can be influenced to increase or decrease it \citep{Khundam2015}. Although the applied gestures are understandable and easy to learn, they still brings some unfamiliarity with them since in real life movement already has a specific gesture which however utilizes the legs and not the hands.
\begin{figure}[h]

		\label{fig:leapmotion}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\newline
For their research on static and stroke gestures, \cite{Chun2015} made use of a depth-camera in order to track hand gestures and combined it with speech recognition. The latter is discussed in more detail in chapter \ref{SubSubSectionSpeechRecognition} which covers the methods of speech recognition in general. \cite{Chun2015} defined different hand and finger gestures for selecting, moving, scaling, rotating, copying and deleting objects, all of which actions had to be confirmed by a specific yes/no gesture. This set of gestures makes it a very natural, intuitive and interactive way for the user to alter virtual objects. As often with the use cameras, there are limitations to it. The hand has to be tracked properly for the whole performance of the gesture and it has to be done with the right speed for a proper recognition of the command \citep{Chun2015}.


\subsubsection{Gesture Controllers}

Very similar to the hand gestures, the gesture controllers intend to improve the tracking of the hand movements by adding hardware to the hands of the users that is easier to track but still leaves options for simple interaction with buttons and triggers. \newline
One of the first commercial gesture controllers was the \textit{PlayStation Move}, introduced by \cite{Sony2010}. While the controller itself can detect its own motion, the position is tracked with a camera attached to the PlayStation. This allows for a more accurate tracking of a specific point which \cite{Takala2014} made use of by attaching a PlayStation Move to their HMD in order to have a more accurate positioning than it was possible with solely the Microsoft Kinect. \newline
Alongside the \textit{HTC Vive} HMD, a new gesture controller also have been introduced \citep{Htcvive2016}. In combination with the Lighthouse technology (described in chapter \ref{360MotionTracking}), the controllers can also be properly tracked if they are e.g. hidden behind the back of the user, which is not possible with the PlayStation Move. Figure \ref{fig:gesturecontroller} shows this controller with its unique design for the tracking sensors (6) and a combination of track-pad (2), buttons (1, 3 and 8) and a trigger (7). By putting the thumb on the track-pad, the index finger on the trigger and the other three fingers on the side button it almost allows to track the grabbing motion of the hand.

		\label{fig:gesturecontroller}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Speech Recognition}

\label{SubSubSectionSpeechRecognition}

The second natural interaction after hand gestures is speech recognition It is often combined with hand gesture as they can complement each other quite seamlessly. \newline
For the navigation within 3D scans from \gls{mri} or \gls{ct}, \cite{Muller1998} proposed a speech recognition system as illustrated with an example in figure \ref{fig:speechrecognitionmedical}. With semantic decoding and a semantic structure, the commands can be interpreted and processed by the intention decoder to tell the system what to \citep{Muller1998}. This is a very time-consuming process since all commands have to be prepared and acoustic-phonetic models need to be generated during the collection of training data. Provided the users followed the instructions, a 99.8\% semantic accuracy could be achieved which basically means that the system is almost fully accurate in this scenario \citep{Muller1998}.

		\caption[Architecture and example of speech recognition and interaction for physicians]{Architecture and example of speech recognition and interaction for physicians \citep{Muller1998}}
		\label{fig:speechrecognitionmedical}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\newline
\cite{Uchino2008} combined speech recognition with a camera to identify where the user is pointing at on a computer screen to interact with a virtual agent. In their example, a set of pens with different colours are presented to the user where the selection is made in combination with gestures (pointing at the pen) and speech (e.g. "\textit{Please give the red one}") \citep{Uchino2008}. Figure \ref{fig:speechrecignitionpen} shows how such a conversation with a virtual agent can proceed where the agent picks the wrong pen based on the pointing and ambiguous speech and thus has to be corrected to pick the one with the right colour Although this research was not focussed on virtual reality, this research can also be applied in virtual reality which might even improve the accuracy of the pointing gesture.

		\includegraphics[width=10cm]{03_Figures/05_LitReview/Uchino2008_SpeechPointing.png}
		\caption[Flow of a conversation with the virtual pen agent]{Flow of a conversation with the virtual pen agent \citep{Uchino2008}}
		\label{fig:speechrecignitionpen}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\newline
As described in chapter \ref{SubSubSectionHandGestures}, \cite{Chun2015} utilized hand gestures to interact with virtual objects and further enhanced them with speech recognition. While objects can be altered in their spatial appearance, speech is used to change the colour of the object or ask questions about the type, shape or colour of it \citep{Chun2015}. Instead of relying on a physical device with buttons to change the colours, a multi-modal interaction combines speech and gesture to a more natural and intuitive method that is also closer to the real world \citep{Chun2015} .


\subsubsection{Physical Placement of Interactive Objects}

Quite a bit older, from the 1990s, is the idea of dynamically placing physical knobs and switches in front of a seated user wearing a HMD \citep{Latham1997}. The trajectory of the users hand and its movement is extrapolated in order to move the correct type of control in the right position just when it is expected in the virtual reality environment \citep{Latham1997}. Figure \ref{fig:touchcockpit} shows the concept of \cite{Latham1997} as well as how the final design looked like. Since such a machine requires a lot of time to design and build, it can be assumed that these are parts of the reason why not many further advancements were undertaken.

		\label{fig:touchcockpit}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Full Body Tracking}

In June 2010, Microsoft announced the \textit{Kinect for Xbox 360}, a controller-free gaming device for the living room \citep{Microsoft2010}. Instead of relying on any physical input devices, the Kinect contains a camera with motion-sensing technology that can track up to 48 points of movement on the human body, turning the player himself into a controller \citep{Microsoft2010}. \newline
Based on this technology, \cite{Takala2014} proposed a combination of a full body avatar controlled by Kinect with the Oculus Rift as display. This combination proved to be quite powerful although they were facing a couple of challenges as well. The Kinect sometimes lost track of the hands or the movement was not recognized at all which \cite{Takala2014} tried to resolve by attaching a PlayStation Move to the HMD and put a Razer Hydra controller into the hands (Figure \ref{fig:kinectbody}). Although this improved the situation, different latencies of the individual dampened the experience. Furthermore, although Kinect was used for full-body tracking, only the movement of the hands and legs was utilized, whereas the movement within the virtual world was still relying on a physical controller.

		\label{fig:kinectbody}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{360° Motion Tracking}
\label{360MotionTracking}

One of the latest additions to the interaction possibilities is the 360° motion tracking, introduced with the HTC Vive which was just released in April 2016 \citep{Htcvive2016}. Figure \ref{fig:lighthouses} shows the setup of the two base stations (i.e. Lighthouses) in opposing corners of the room that will be used for the 360° motion tracking. In essence, the two Lighthouse base stations emit a laser sweep across the room 60 times a second with a flash in between which allows any device with photo-sensors to calculate its exact position relative to the base station(s) \citep{Gizmodo2015}. This allows for a very accurate tracking and due to the opposing corners, at least one Lighthouse always has direct \textit{line of sight} to the HMD and the controllers. \newline
With this additional sensor information, the movement of the HMD and the controllers is tracked in all three axis and allow for new movements to be recognized, such as crouching or jumping within the relations of the room.

	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=10cm]{03_Figures/05_LitReview/HTCCorp2016_LighthouseRoomScale.png}

		\label{fig:lighthouses}
	\end{center}
\end{figure} \newline
A more simplified variation of this is described by \cite{Donalek2014}, who used a ViconTM motion-capturing system with infrared markers on the HMD to track its spatial location. This allowed \cite{Donalek2014} to also recognize movements such as kneeling down or looking over and around objects in the scene, however always limited by the volume that was covered by the Vicon system.

\end{table}

The literature review on different methods for user input in virtual reality showed that there are various types can be used or even combined. \newline
There are six main methods for user input in virtual reality. These are hand gestures, gesture controllers, speech recognition, physical placement of interactive objects, full body tracking and 360° motion tracking. Hand gestures track the movement of the whole hand and/or the individual fingers with one or more (regular, infra-red or depth) cameras. Gesture controllers are physical devices with buttons that are held in the hands and also tracked in their spatial position. Speech recognition tries to understand and interpret spoken words and sentences in order to find the correct commands. The physical placement of interstice objects extrapolates the movement of the hand to physically place a button in front of the finger where a virtual one is shown in V Full body tracking uses cameras to track the whole body including the movement of all extremities from one angle. Finally, 360° motion tracking can locate the position of special devices within an actual room on all three axis from opposing corners. The most used method in the reviewed literature is the hand gestures, followed by the hand gestures in combination with speech recognition \newline
Depending on the chosen method, there are advantages and disadvantages (or even limitations) for certain use cases. Table \ref{tbl:methodscomparison} shows a summary of these findings.

In regards of the thesis statement, a combination of two methods is recommended to outweigh the individual disadvantages and utilize the benefits of both methods.

\section{Existing Data Interaction Patterns in Virtual Reality}

\label{SectionLiteratureReviewSRQ2}

This chapter addresses the second SRQ by having a look at existing interaction patterns with data in virtual reality and evaluating their strengths and weaknesses. The introduction starts with interaction patterns in general, followed by an analysis of the visual information seeking mantra and the idea of multi-modal interaction. A conclusion summarises the research done in this chapter.

	\textit{SRQ 2: Which ways of interaction with multi-dimensional data exist and what are their strengths and weaknesses?}
\end{framed}

%-----------------------------------
%	SUBSECTION 1
%-----------------------------------

\subsection{Introduction}

As early as in the 1980s, interaction patterns with data have already been defined, such as the "Put-That-There" voice and gesture interface as described by \cite{Bolt1980}. This interfaces focus on certain voice command to manipulate objects in a virtual space which have been defined as following \citep{Bolt1980}:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item "Create..." \textit{(a default object, with default size and colour on a default position)}
	\item "Move..." \textit{(an object to a specific position)}
	\item "Make that..." \textit{(altering an object in colour and size)}
	\item "Delete..." \textit{(removal of an object)}
	\item "Call that..." \textit{(give an object a name to which it can be referred to)}
\end{itemize}
In addition, the spoken \textit{"there"} serves as some kind of voice button where the \textit{"there"} refers to the cursor position, thus introducing the gestures as an input method for this interface \citep{Bolt1980}. \newline
It can be seen that even more than three decades ago, the need to simplify more complicated interactions such as changing the colour of an object which would require multiple inputs with mouse/keyboard, were tested to be simplified with new means of interaction patterns.

\subsection{Multi-modal  something}

\cite{Bunt1998} stated that "Human communication is inherently multimodal in nature".

In our virtual environment, a fully immersed person is working on a specific task and several (up to 20) outsiders (participants) observe the fully immersed person and would like to comment and affect the fully immersed person’s work. \cite{Deligiannidis2003}

The current communication technique used is vocal instruction, which is distracting to everyone. This paper presents a technique in which the fully immersed person and the participants can interact using a second camera directed for a third person’s view of the environment. This technique attempts to provide the best of both worlds (first and third person views) so the formerly passive participants can become more immersed in the environment. \cite{Deligiannidis2003}

The space around the participant who is controlling the camera is divided into two hemispheres, the top and the bottom one. Camera manipulation is activated when both sensors enter the top hemisphere, and hand manipulation is activated when both hands enter the bottom hemisphere. \cite{Deligiannidis2003}


Since wearing of the goggles effectively precludes the use of a keyboard interface, we need a tool where a user can use physical gestures to manipulate virtual objects and data displays. \cite{Donalek2014} - Leap Motion


At our demonstrations, we observed that many users had difficulty interacting with keyboard and mouse when they could not see their hands, but most users were able to use the Xbox controller intuitively. Figure 4 shows a demonstration of the first implementation of the prototype from the 2015 Joint NSRC Workshop on Big, Deep, and Smart Data Analytics in Materials Imaging. Users were able to “fly” through the data and, using the Oculus head-tracking, look around and view the data from different perspectives. \cite{Drouhard2015}
