\section{Different Methods for User Input in Virtual Reality}

\label{SectionLiteratureReviewSRQ1}

This chapter deals with the first SRQ, focusing on the currently used and researched different methods for user input in virtual reality. It starts with an introduction and an overview of the different methods while the subsequent chapters give more details on the individual methods.

\subsection{Introduction}

\gls{hci} itself has been worked and research on approximately from the 1950s onwards, where the main focus was on the direct manipulation of graphical objects with the mouse as well as gesture recognition \citep{Myers1998}. During this time however, gesture recognition was rather understood as devices that work with pen-based input devices and thus can recognize patterns that are drawn with these pens \citep{Myers1998}. In the regular interaction between human and machines these methods for user input are still fairly sufficient as even today we are completely relying on having a mouse/track-pad/touch-screen and a keyboard to interact with our devices. \newline
Virtual reality changes this quite a bit since wearing a \gls{hmd} with its own display obstructs the view on the so far used physical input devices. New solutions had to be found for this changed situation. An overview on the researched interaction patterns with virtual reality is shown in the following sub-chapter.

\subsection{Overview of the Different Methods}

The reviewed literature brought up different means in research to interact with the virtual reality environment. In order to review them in a more structured way, they have been grouped by their core technology (i.e. hand gestures, speech recognition etc.) on which they base on. Every core technology is discussed individually, its advantages and disadvantages are discussed, as well as their similarities or differences are explained.


\subsubsection{Hand Gestures}

\label{SubSubSectionHandGestures}

The by far most utilized and researched interaction method is hand gestures. Since we also heavily rely on this interaction pattern in real life with other human beings, it is fair to assume that the familiarity of it helps the research in a significant way whereas methods that rely on physical hardware often feel more distant. \newline
\cite{Pfeiffer2008} conducted an empirical study about conversational pointing gestures in virtual reality interaction where the focus lied on the system to recognize on which object the user was pointing at. \cite{Pfeiffer2008} distinguished between \gls{ifp} where the direction of where the index finger is pointing at, and \gls{gfp} where an imaginary line between the viewers eye and the tip of the index finger is drawn. Provided the objects are nod too close to each other (ca. 20cm), both methods had equal accuracy and success while tracked with two cameras from different angles and motion capturing \citep{Pfeiffer2008}. Figure \ref{fig:pointinggesture} shows the application of this in an identification game which was part of the empirical study.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=10cm]{03_Figures/05_LitReview/Pfeiffer2008_Pointing.png}
		\caption[Cone-based model for extension of pointing gestures refined for identification game]{Cone-based model for extension of pointing gestures (left) refined for identification game (right) \citep{Pfeiffer2008}}
		\label{fig:pointinggesture}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\newline
A similar approach has been research by \cite{Rautaray2011} who used a single camera with an application that did the image capturing, locating the hand and its orientation and finally modelling the gesture to find a match for predefined gestures. The focus relied on simple gestures for \textit{punch} (three fingers), \textit{grab} (fist), \textit{throw} (five fingers), and to \textit{move forward} (thumb up) within a simple \gls{vr} game \citep{Rautaray2011}. The recognition rate was between 80\% and 94\% (depending on the gesture), which might not be accurate enough for practical use cases as also acknowledged by \cite{Rautaray2011}. \newline
In a more recent study of \cite{Khundam2015}, it was not cameras that were used to track the hand gestures but a Leap Motion (an in-air controller) attached to the front of an Oculus Rift. Figure \ref{fig:leapmotion} shows the different gestures that were implemented by \cite{Khundam2015} in order to navigate within a virtual environment. Depending on how far the hand is moved towards a certain angle, the speed of the movement can be influenced to increase or decrease it \citep{Khundam2015}. Although the applied gestures are understandable and easy to learn, they still bring some unfamiliarity with them since in real life movement already has a specific gesture which however utilizes the legs and not the hands.
\begin{figure}[h]

		\label{fig:leapmotion}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\newline
For their research on static and stroke gestures, \cite{Chun2015} made use of a depth-camera in order to track hand gestures and combined it with speech recognition. The latter is discussed in more detail in chapter \ref{SubSubSectionSpeechRecognition} which covers the methods of speech recognition in general. \cite{Chun2015} defined different hand and finger gestures for selecting, moving, scaling, rotating, copying and deleting objects, all of which actions had to be confirmed by a specific yes/no gesture. This set of gestures makes it a very natural, intuitive and interactive way for the user to alter virtual objects. As often with the use cameras, there are limitations to it. The hand has to be tracked properly for the whole performance of the gesture and it has to be done with the right speed for a proper recognition of the command \citep{Chun2015}.


\subsubsection{Gesture Controllers}

Very similar to the hand gestures, the gesture controllers intend to improve the tracking of the hand movements by adding hardware to the hands of the users that is easier to track but still leaves options for simple interaction with buttons and triggers. \newline
One of the first commercial gesture controllers was the \textit{PlayStation Move}, introduced by \cite{Sony2010}. While the controller itself can detect its own motion, the position is tracked with a camera attached to the PlayStation. This allows for a more accurate tracking of a specific point which \cite{Takala2014} made use of by attaching a PlayStation Move to their HMD in order to have a more accurate positioning than it was possible with solely the Microsoft Kinect. \newline
Alongside the \textit{HTC Vive} HMD, a new gesture controller also have been introduced \citep{Htcvive2016}. In combination with the Lighthouse technology (described in chapter \ref{360MotionTracking}), the controllers can also be properly tracked if they are e.g. hidden behind the back of the user, which is not possible with the PlayStation Move. Figure \ref{fig:gesturecontroller} shows this controller with its unique design for the tracking sensors (6) and a combination of track-pad (2), buttons (1, 3 and 8) and a trigger (7). By putting the thumb on the track-pad, the index finger on the trigger and the other three fingers on the side button it almost allows to track the grabbing motion of the hand.

		\label{fig:gesturecontroller}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Speech Recognition}

\label{SubSubSectionSpeechRecognition}

The second natural interaction after hand gestures is speech recognition It is often combined with hand gesture as they can complement each other quite seamlessly. \newline
For the navigation within 3D scans from \gls{mri} or \gls{ct}, \cite{Muller1998} proposed a speech recognition system as illustrated with an example in Figure \ref{fig:speechrecognitionmedical}. With semantic decoding and a semantic structure, the commands can be interpreted and processed by the intention decoder to tell the system what to do \citep{Muller1998}. This is a very time-consuming process since all commands have to be prepared and acoustic-phonetic models need to be generated during the collection of training data. Provided the users followed the instructions, a 99.8\% semantic accuracy could be achieved which basically means that the system is almost fully accurate in this scenario \citep{Muller1998}.
\begin{figure}[h]

		\includegraphics[width=10cm]{03_Figures/05_LitReview/Muller1998_SpeechRecognition.png}
		\caption[Architecture and example of speech recognition and interaction for physicians]{Architecture and example of speech recognition and interaction for physicians \citep{Muller1998}}
		\label{fig:speechrecognitionmedical}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\newline
\cite{Uchino2008} combined speech recognition with a camera to identify where the user is pointing at on a computer screen to interact with a virtual agent. In their example, a set of pens with different colours are presented to the user where the selection is made in combination with gestures (pointing at the pen) and speech (e.g. "\textit{Please give the red one}") \citep{Uchino2008}. Figure \ref{fig:speechrecignitionpen} shows how such a conversation with a virtual agent can proceed where the agent picks the wrong pen based on the pointing and ambiguous speech and thus has to be corrected to pick the one with the right colour Although this research was not focussed on virtual reality, this research can also be applied in virtual reality which might even improve the accuracy of the pointing gesture.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=10cm]{03_Figures/05_LitReview/Uchino2008_SpeechPointing.png}
		\caption[Flow of a conversation with the virtual pen agent]{Flow of a conversation with the virtual pen agent \citep{Uchino2008}}
		\label{fig:speechrecignitionpen}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\newline
As described in chapter \ref{SubSubSectionHandGestures}, \cite{Chun2015} utilized hand gestures to interact with virtual objects and further enhanced them with speech recognition. While objects can be altered in their spatial appearance, speech is used to change the colour of the object or ask questions about the type, shape or colour of it \citep{Chun2015}. Instead of relying on a physical device with buttons to change the colours, a multi-modal interaction combines speech and gesture to a more natural and intuitive method that is also closer to the real world \citep{Chun2015} .


\subsubsection{Physical Placement of Interactive Objects}

Quite a bit older, from the 1990s, is the idea of dynamically placing physical knobs and switches in front of a seated user wearing a HMD \citep{Latham1997}. The trajectory of the users hand and its movement is extrapolated in order to move the correct type of control in the right position just when it is expected in the virtual reality environment \citep{Latham1997}. Figure \ref{fig:touchcockpit} shows the concept of \cite{Latham1997} as well as how the final design looked like. Since such a machine requires a lot of time to design and build, it can be assumed that these are parts of the reason why not many further advancements were undertaken.

		\label{fig:touchcockpit}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Full Body Tracking}

In June 2010, Microsoft announced the \textit{Kinect for Xbox 360}, a controller-free gaming device for the living room \citep{Microsoft2010}. Instead of relying on any physical input devices, the Kinect contains a camera with motion-sensing technology that can track up to 48 points of movement on the human body, turning the player himself into a controller \citep{Microsoft2010}. \newline
Based on this technology, \cite{Takala2014} proposed a combination of a full body avatar controlled by Kinect with the Oculus Rift as display. This combination proved to be quite powerful although they were facing a couple of challenges as well. The Kinect sometimes lost track of the hands or the movement was not recognized at all which \cite{Takala2014} tried to resolve by attaching a PlayStation Move to the HMD and put a Razer Hydra controller into the hands (Figure \ref{fig:kinectbody}). Although this improved the situation, different latencies of the individual devices dampened the experience. Furthermore, although Kinect was used for full-body tracking, only the movement of the hands and legs was utilized, whereas the movement within the virtual world was still relying on a physical controller.

		\label{fig:kinectbody}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{360° Motion Tracking}
\label{360MotionTracking}

One of the latest additions to the interaction possibilities is the 360° motion tracking, introduced with the HTC Vive which was just released in April 2016 \citep{Htcvive2016}. Figure \ref{fig:lighthouses} shows the setup of the two base stations (i.e. Lighthouses) in opposing corners of the room that will be used for the 360° motion tracking. In essence, the two Lighthouse base stations emit a laser sweep across the room 60 times a second with a flash in between which allows any device with photo-sensors to calculate its exact position relative to the base station(s) \citep{Gizmodo2015}. This allows for a very accurate tracking and due to the opposing corners, at least one Lighthouse always has direct \textit{line of sight} to the HMD and the controllers. \newline
With this additional sensor information, the movement of the HMD and the controllers is tracked in all three axis and allows for new movements to be recognized, such as crouching or jumping within the relations of the room.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=10cm]{03_Figures/05_LitReview/HTCCorp2016_LighthouseRoomScale.png}
		\caption[Two Lighthouse in opposing corners allow for 360° motion tracking]{Two Lighthouse in opposing corners allow for 360° motion tracking \citep{HTCCorp2016}}
		\label{fig:lighthouses}
	\end{center}
\end{figure} \newline
A more simplified variation of this is described by \cite{Donalek2014}, who used a ViconTM motion-capturing system with infrared markers on the HMD to track its spatial location. This allowed \cite{Donalek2014} to also recognize movements such as kneeling down or looking over and around objects in the scene, however always limited by the volume that was covered by the Vicon system. \newline
The main difference to full body tracking is that the 360° motion tracking relies on physical sensors to derive their (i.e. the sensors) position within three dimensional space compared to the detection of any movable object (usually the body of a person). This method is much more accurate than the full body tracking, but requires additional hardware to do so.

\subsection{Conclusion}

The literature review on different methods for user input in virtual reality showed that there are various types which can be used or even combined. \newline
There are six main methods for user input in virtual reality. These are hand gestures, gesture controllers, speech recognition, physical placement of interactive objects, full body tracking and 360° motion tracking. Hand gestures track the movement of the whole hand and/or the individual fingers with one or more (regular, infra-red or depth) cameras. Gesture controllers are physical devices with buttons that are held in the hands and also tracked in their spatial position. Speech recognition tries to understand and interpret spoken words and sentences in order to find the correct commands. The physical placement of interstice objects extrapolates the movement of the hand to physically place a button in front of the finger where a virtual one is shown in \gls{vr}. Full body tracking uses cameras to track the whole body including the movement of all extremities from one angle. Finally, 360° motion tracking can locate the position of special devices within an actual room on all three axis from opposing corners. The most used method in the reviewed literature is the hand gestures, followed by the hand gestures in combination with speech recognition \newline
Depending on the chosen method, there are advantages and disadvantages (or even limitations) for certain use cases. Table \ref{tbl:methodscomparison} shows a summary of these findings and is also the answer to the first \gls{srq}.

In regards of the thesis statement, a combination of two methods is recommended to outweigh the individual disadvantages and utilize the benefits of both methods.

\section{Existing Interaction Patterns in Virtual Reality}

\label{SectionLiteratureReviewSRQ2}

This chapter addresses the second SRQ by having a look at existing interaction patterns in virtual reality and evaluating their strengths and weaknesses. It starts with a short introduction, followed by an analysis of the visual information seeking mantra. Then more details are given on different interaction patterns for travel, selection and manipulation as well as the idea of multi-modal interaction, before the importance of immersion and task performance is elaborated. A conclusion summarises the research done in this chapter.

\end{framed}

%-----------------------------------

\subsection{Introduction}

During the 1960s, the first interaction patterns such as clicking or grabbing and moving objects have been defined on which even now we are still relying on with mouse and keyboard \citep{Myers1998}. But with wearing a \gls{hmd}, the situation changes as it obstructs our view on the so well known devices. New methods for user input had to be researched and inherently also new interaction patterns had to be defined. \cite{Donalek2014} mentioned that a new tool is required where physical gestures can be used to manipulate with virtual objects. In order to understand what kind of gestures should be considered, the Visual Information Seeking Mantra of \cite{Shneiderman1996} is looked at.


%-----------------------------------
%	SUBSECTION 2
%-----------------------------------

\subsection{Visual Information Seeking Mantra}

\cite{Shneiderman2005} defined a set of principles for direct manipulation, amongst which are:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item visual representation of the world of action including both the objects and actions
	\item rapid, incremental and reversible actions
	\item selection by pointing (instead of typing)
\end{itemize}
Based on this, \cite{Ahlberg1994} proposed the Visual Information Seeking Principle in 1994 that focused in displaying a graph with buttons and sliders for real-time manipulation of the displayed data. This concept fulfilled all principles for direct manipulation and was so successful that it became the foundation for the \gls{vism} \citep{Shneiderman1996}. \cite{Shneiderman1996} was looking at many visual design guidelines but fundamentally always concluded the following mantra:
\begin{framed}
	\textit{Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand}
\end{framed}
As an abstraction of reality, \cite{Shneiderman1996} further defined seven tasks (four main and three support tasks) that are inherently crucial for the analysis and work with data.

Main tasks:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Overview \textit{(Gain an overview of the entire collection)}
	\item Zoom \textit{(Zoom in on items of interest)}
	\item Filter \textit{(Filter out uninteresting items)}
	\item Details-on-demand \textit{(Select and item or group and get details when needed)}
\end{itemize}
Support tasks:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Relate \textit{(View relationships among items)}
	\item History \textit{(Keep a history of actions to support undo, replace and refinement)}
	\item Extract \textit{(Allow extraction of sub-collections and of the query parameters)}
\end{itemize}
Figure \ref{fig:vism} shows a visualisation of these tasks as well as the relationship to each other. It shows that in order to move from the \textit{Overview} to the \textit{Details}, the user either has to \textit{Zoom} or apply some \textit{Filtering} on the presented data set.
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=12cm]{03_Figures/05_LitReview/Stauffer2016_VISM1.png}
		\caption[Visual Information Seeking Mantra]{Visual Information Seeking Mantra \citep{Stauffer2016}}
		\label{fig:vism}
	\end{center}
\end{figure} \newline
\cite{Stauffer2016} reviewed and extended the \gls{vism} to version 2.0. By distinguishing between \textit{Zoom In} and \textit{Zoom Out} as well as allowing for a more flexible entry point for the different tasks, they also deal with one of the big downfalls of \gls{vism} when a user already knows what data is important and thus does not want to start with the \textit{Overview} \citep{Neil2006}. Shifting \textit{Relate} to the main tasks helps to align it with \textit{Details} to provide a multi view where multiples views can be shown and altered simultaneously \citep{Stauffer2016}. The additional \textit{Collaboration} support tasks suggest that communication possibilities should be implemented directly inside the the application system instead of relying on third party applications. Figure \ref{fig:vism2} shows version 2.0 of the \gls{vism} with a direct comparison of 1.0 (green) and 2.0 (orange). \newline
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=12cm]{03_Figures/05_LitReview/Stauffer2016_VISM2.png}
		\caption[Visual Information Seeking Mantra 2.0]{Visual Information Seeking Mantra 2.0 \citep{Stauffer2016}}
		\label{fig:vism2}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

In the analysis of \gls{vism} by \cite{Craft2005}, they point out that it should only be seen as guidelines and also note that although it defines some tasks that a system \textit{should} fulfil, it gives no indication on the question \textit{"How?"}. This conclusion can still be seen as valid since also with version 2.0 of the \gls{vism}, the focus remains on what kind of interaction should be present and not how these interactions could look like.

\subsection{Interaction Patterns}

\cite{Bunt1998} stated that "Human communication is inherently multimodal in nature". What he meant with this is that in a multi-modal user interface, a user can combine a spoken natural language request with one or more gestures \citep{Rosson2002}. By allowing this combination, the interaction in virtual reality can become closer to how we already interact with each other in real life. \newline
In order to understand the different interaction patterns better, \cite{Bowman2002} has grouped them in three distinctive categories: Travel, Selection and Manipulation. \textit{Travel} deals with how the user can navigate in the virtual environment, how the movement and visual exploration works. \textit{Selection} focuses on the first interaction with a virtual object, how one or many object can be selected and how this is visualised for the user. Finally, in \textit{Manipulation} the actual alteration of a virtual object in its appearance and behaviour is discussed.


%-----------------------------------
%	SUBSUBSECTION 1
%-----------------------------------

\subsubsection{Travel}

In \gls{vr}, the most important interaction pattern is the navigation itself, since without navigation the experience is not much different from a 2D display. \cite{Kwon2015} and \cite{Jamieson2007} confirmed in their research that the simplest method for this is to utilize the built in head tracking capabilities of the \gls{hmd} itself. It in fact is more familiar to us humans to examine objects of interest this way, rather than using mouse and keyboard \citep{Jamieson2007}. Either with the gyroscope sensor information or with tracking the position and direction of the camera, this information allows to determine where the user is looking at \citep{Kwon2015}. \cite{Jamieson2007} continue that for a totally immersive experience in \gls{vr}, also body movement would have to be tracked to allow to walk around or even to put the head inside the visualised data objects.

\cite{Deligiannidis2003} researched this topic based on a problem from practice where a person is working on a specific task in \gls{vr} and up to 20 outsider participants can observe and comment on the work of the fully immersed person. The use of vocal instructions however was distracting to everyone and there were no possibilities for the outsiders to interact with the virtual environment \citep{Deligiannidis2003}. Their solution to this was dividing the area in front of each outsider into two hemispheres, reaching with the hands in the top one allowed each person to manipulate the camera (third person view) whereas if the hands are on the lower one the hand manipulation (first person view) was activated \citep{Deligiannidis2003}. This combination allowed the before passive observers to be much more immersed in the virtual environment and to do exploration on their own.

During their demonstrations, \cite{Drouhard2015} observed difficulties when the users wearing a \gls{hmd} had to interact (blindly) with keyboard and mouse, whereas most of them could use an Xbox controller rather intuitively. In their application, the controller was used to "fly" around within the virtual environment and the head tracking capabilities of the \gls{hmd} allowed them to explore the environment and look at the data from different perspectives \citep{Drouhard2015}.

\cite{Bowman2002} also defined guidelines for designing travel techniques, which inherently are related to the navigation and can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Make simple travel tasks simple by using target-based techniques
	\item Use physical head motion for viewpoint orientation if possible
	\item Avoid teleportation; provide smooth transitional motion between locations instead
	\item If steering techniques are used, users should be trained beforehand
	\item Use non-head-coupled techniques for efficiency in relative motion tasks
	\item Provide integrated aids to help the user decide where to move
\end{itemize}

The reviewed literature showed that for looking around, researchers exclusively relied on the head-tracking capabilities of the \gls{hmd} whereas for the travel in space either third-party controllers were used or the idea of full body tracking was briefly mentioned.

On a more practical side, \cite{CloudheadGames2016} released their \gls{vr} game \textit{The Gallery - Episode 1: Call of the Starseed} for the HTC Vive in April 2016 and offered two different ways for travelling in the virtual environment. The player can chose between "gaze-teleportation" where the location to be teleported at is controlled with the \gls{hmd} and confirmed with a click, or "point-teleportation" where the target spot is chosen and confirmed by pointing at with the gesture controller \citep{CloudheadGames2016}. While the travelling with gaze follows the research of \cite{Jamieson2007} and their conclusion that using the \gls{hmd} is the simplest method, it limits the possibilities for multitasking. By utilizing the gesture controllers for travelling, a certain independence of the viewing experience is achieved and allows "blind" travelling without the need to also look into that direction, just like if we walk backwards in the real world. Both methods of travelling are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:gazePointTeleportation}.

The fact that both options are provided for the player to chose from can be seen as an indication, that even in practice for entertainment purposes, there is no clear strategy yet as to which travelling method is more natural, efficient or practical.

\subsubsection{Selection}

After looking at \textit{Travel}, the second interaction pattern is the selection of objects in the virtual environment either to get more information on them or to do manipulate them in a subsequent step. Based on the selected input method, different patterns come to action. \newline
\cite{Bowman2002} also defined guidelines for designing selection techniques that can be summarised as follow:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Use the natural virtual hand technique if all selection is within arm's reach
	\item Use ray-casting techniques if speed of remote selection is a requirement
	\item The chosen selection technique should integrates well with the manipulation technique
	\item Multi-modal input for combined selection and command tasks
	\item Environment design should maximize the perceived size of objects
	\item Provide integrated aids to help the user decide where to move
\end{itemize}

Research showed, that three main types of selection patterns have been research: Hand, HMD Reticle and Gesture Controllers.

\subparagraph{Hand}

\cite{Steed2006} researched different simple selection techniques using the hand. He distinguishes between Ray-based selection, Small Volume Selection and Cone Selection which are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:selectiontechniques} \citep{Steed2006}. In the Ray-based selection, an imaginary ray is cast in the direction of the hand to choose the first object interacts with (object A), whereas in the Small Volume selection, the intersection of the hand with the volume of an object determines the selection (object C) \citep{Steed2006}. Lastly, \cite{Steed2006} defined the Cone Selection similar to the Ray-based one, however there are two rays in this case and all objects that are in between them are considered selected (objects E and F). \newline
Each technique has different applications where it makes more sense or allows for a better immersion than any of the other techniques, such as when a virtual button or handle can be triggered, the Small Volume selection can be considered the closest to how we would interact in the real world. \newline
Since these techniques are highly linked to the methods of using hand gestures as input, they bring their strengths and weaknesses along. While it is the most familiar way for humans to interact (or in this case to select something), it is highly depending on accurate tracking capabilities and good interpretation of gestures if more than a simple pointing gesture is required.

		\label{fig:selectiontechniques}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}


\subparagraph{HMD Reticle}

\cite{Kwon2015} and \cite{Drouhard2015} focused their research on a selection technique using a reticle that is visualised inside the \gls{hmd}, like a cross-hair. When the user selects a node with this reticle, this node and its neighbours are brought closer to the user and are highlighted in order to see more details and allow the user to make further selections \citep{Kwon2015}. With the option to select multiple nodes and the visualization of the nodes amongst themselves, interesting paths or relations can be visualized in an effective way \citep{Kwon2015}. It however is not mentioned how the selection itself is triggered, whether a button has to be pushed or if the gaze just has to be held for a couple of seconds. It is also not mentioned how the "\textit{Zoom Out}" task can be performed. \newline
\cite{Drouhard2015} provided more details on this part in their research where they implement a "target mode" that the user can enter. Only in this case the cross-hair reticle is shown to the user and the selection happens by targeting a data object and pressing the trigger button \citep{Drouhard2015}. It can be assumed that this separation of "target mode" and "view mode" will help the combination of \textit{Selection} and \textit{Travel} and makes the data analysis more convenient as the reticle is only shown when absolutely necessary. \newline
\cite{Drouhard2015} furthermore states that gaze interaction arguably is the most natural form of interaction in virtual environments. \newline
One fact that is not mentioned in literature but becomes clear is that with an \gls{hmd} reticle, the selection is directly linked to the viewing experience. It is not possible to select something without directly looking at it, which inherently limits the multitasking possibilities.


\subparagraph{Gesture Controller}

Finally, also gesture controllers allow for dedicated selection patterns. \cite{Hentschel2009} used a controller to select multiple data points out of a 3D scatter-plot which they called interactive brushing and is shown in Figure \ref{fig:interactivebrushing}. The first (left) picture shows the empty selection box that can be moved and scaled (middle and right picture) in order to make the actual selection \citep{Hentschel2009}. Although the middle and right picture look almost the same, the difference is that with the middle picture the visualization of the scatter-plot is done in real-time and only upon releasing the button on the device, the actual selection with remote selection and computing is done \citep{Hentschel2009}.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=14cm]{03_Figures/05_LitReview/Hentschel2009_InteractiveBrushing.png}
		\caption[Box selection of scatter-plot data in VR]{Box selection of scatter-plot data in VR \citep{Hentschel2009}}
		\label{fig:interactivebrushing}
	\end{center}
\end{figure} \newline
In their game \textit{The Gallery - Episode 1: Call of the Starseed}, \cite{CloudheadGames2016} provide the option to select objects by utilizing the gesture controllers that in \gls{vr} are visualised as hands as shown in Figure \ref{fig:theGalleryHands}. With the trigger button, the hand can be closed and thus objects can be grabbed and moved around. The game further distinguishes between "important" and "unimportant" objects, where the "important" ones are stuck in the grip of the hand even if the trigger was released (i.e. a flashlight) and "unimportant" objects would immediately drop once the trigger button is released. This allows for a more convenient interaction since it can become irritating to keep the trigger button held for a longer amount of time. \newline
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=7cm]{03_Figures/05_LitReview/Cloudhead2016_TheGallery.png}
		\includegraphics[width=7cm]{03_Figures/05_LitReview/Cloudhead2016_TheGallery3.png}
		\caption[Gesture Controllers visualized as Hands in "The Gallery"]{Gesture Controllers visualized as Hands in "The Gallery" \citep{CloudheadGames2016}}
		\label{fig:theGalleryHands}
	\end{center}
\end{figure} \newline
As with the selection by hand, also the selection by gesture controllers brings their advantages and disadvantages from the method as an input device itself with them. While they offer very good accuracy and increased functionality with buttons and triggers, it requires additional hardware and tracking devices.

%	SUBSUBSECTION 3
%-----------------------------------

\subsubsection{Manipulation}

As early as in the 1980s, interaction patterns with data (i.e. manipulations) have already been defined, such as the "Put-That-There" voice and gesture interface as described by \cite{Bolt1980}. This interfaces focus on certain voice command to manipulate objects in a virtual space which have been defined as following \citep{Bolt1980}:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item "Create..." \textit{(a default object, with default size and colour on a default position)}
	\item "Move..." \textit{(an object to a specific position)}
	\item "Make that..." \textit{(altering an object in colour and size)}
	\item "Delete..." \textit{(removal of an object)}
	\item "Call that..." \textit{(give an object a name to which it can be referred to)}
\end{itemize}
In addition, the spoken \textit{"there"} serves as some kind of voice button where the \textit{"there"} refers to the cursor position, thus introducing the gestures as an input method for this interface \citep{Bolt1980}.
It can be seen that even more than three decades ago, the need to simplify more complicated interactions such as changing the colour of an object, which would require several inputs actions with mouse or keyboard, were tested to be simplified with new means of interaction patterns. \cite{Donalek2014} also mentioned the need for a new tool where the user can manipulate with these objects since wearing a \gls{hmd} blocks the view on the keyboard interface. \newline
\cite{Woodard2015} explained their approach on a more technical level in which they basically utilized the concept of the Small Volume Selection from \cite{Steed2006} to trigger certain manipulations like opening a door (i.e. rotating an object on its axis).

\cite{Bowman2002} again defined guidelines for designing manipulation techniques, that can be summarized as follow:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Provide constraints (general or specific) or manipulation aids
	\item Allow direct manipulation with the virtual hand instead of using a tool
	\item Avoid repeated, frequent scaling of the user or environment
	\item Use indirect depth manipulation for increased efficiency and accuracy
\end{itemize}

Literature review has shown that most research focuses on \textit{Travel} and \textit{Selection} whereas \textit{Manipulation} of data objects is in most cases not covered at all. This is also shown with the defined guidelines from \cite{Bowman2002} as they are more vague than for the other techniques.

With the release of the HTC Vive, \cite{Google2016} released a \gls{vr} application called \textit{Tilt Brush} which basically is a 3D painting application in virtual reality. It allows the user to choose between different pencils, brush sizes, colours and also provides an "undo" functionality, all that is controlled with pop-up menus that can be interacted with using the gesture controllers as shown in Figure \ref{fig:tiltBrushMenus}.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=7cm]{03_Figures/05_LitReview/Google2016_TiltBrush.png}
		\includegraphics[width=7cm]{03_Figures/05_LitReview/Google2016_TiltBrush2.png}
		\caption[Pop-up menu with Gesture Controllers in "Tilt Brush"]{Pop-up menu with Gesture Controllers in "Tilt Brush" \citep{Google2016}}
		\label{fig:tiltBrushMenus}
	\end{center}
\end{figure} \newline
The research of \cite{Bowman2002} has shown, that although this type of non-natural interaction indeed can be quite effective, especially since it allows for tasks to be executed that cannot be done naturally. Although it would be possible to provide a virtual colour palette where the user would have to choose the colour by hand to eliminate this option from the pop-up menu, this would drastically impact the task performance in a negative way.


%-----------------------------------
%	SUBSECTION 4
%-----------------------------------

\subsection{Importance of Immersion and Task Performance}

In addition to the interaction patterns to perform tasks, the level of immersion and the performance of task execution is as important. \cite{Woodard2015} defined three rules a project has to be conform with in order to be as immersive as possible:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Three Dimensional Viewing
	\item Full User-Navigation Integration
	\item Interactive Environment
\end{itemize}
The first two points have to be ensured by the application design itself as well as interaction patterns for \textit{Travel}. The third point is more complex as it covers the interaction patterns for \textit{Selection} and \textit{Manipulation} which are more crucial for the performance.

\cite{Bowman2002} separates the term performance a bit more and considers two aspects of it:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Task performance \textit{(quality of task completion, measured in time, accuracy, ...)}
	\item Technique performance \textit{(qualitative experience of the user during interaction)}
\end{itemize}
Since the technique performance is ultimately related to the concept of usability, which is not part of this thesis, the main focus lies on the task performance.

\cite{Bowman2002} continues that it is a common misconception that in order to be an effective virtual environment, it should behave and work as close to the real world as possible; interaction should be "natural". \cite{Smith1987} called this naturalistic approach "\textit{Naturalism}" whereas the addition of non-natural methods he simply called "\textit{Magic}". The possibility to scale objects or create them out of thin air, to be able to fly around in space are considered to be magic techniques \citep{Bowman2002}. There are also more simple 2D objects such as drop-downs, pop-up menus or buttons that are already widely spread in our everyday applications that we use on computers and smartphones. \cite{Bowman2002} concludes that although these techniques are less natural and might even require some training, if designed for specific interaction tasks, they can be more efficient and flexible than any natural technique.\newline
\cite{Rosson2002} looked at immersion a bit different and summarized it as an "all around" experience for the user which requires multi-modal input (e.g. data gloves or speech recognition) and output (e.g. \gls{hmd} or haptic feedback on a device). The degree to which someone fells like actually being "in" this virtual environment is depending on the available inputs and outputs and is often referred to as presence \citep{Rosson2002}.\newline
It can be said that if a task feels tedious and difficult to execute in \gls{vr}, it will have a difficult time to keep people interested in it, after all it should help us to become more efficient in our task performance.

\subsection{Conclusion}

The \gls{vism} provides a solid foundation of what tasks the interaction patterns should be able to fulfil. It however gives no guidelines or recommendations in how these interaction patterns could look like. The interaction patterns can be grouped into three categories: \textit{Travel}, \textit{Selection} and \textit{Manipulation}. Each of them has its own patterns which are more or less suited for certain applications. In general it can be seen that the \textit{Manipulation} pattern are researched the least so far and can be a suitable candidate for further research. Whichever interaction pattern is selected and implemented, its ability to allow the user to have a good task performance is crucial for any practical applications. \newline
In general, the strengths and weaknesses of the individual patterns are heavily related to advantages and disadvantages of the input method they base on. It can be said that the interaction patterns have to be selected in correlation with the decision for the matching input methods. Table \ref{tbl:pattermethodmapping} shows a mapping of pattern and method.
\begin{table}[t]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{ | p{4cm} | p{6cm} | } 
			\hline
			\textbf{Interaction Pattern} & \textbf{Input Method} \\
			\hline
			Travel:  \newline \textit{Controllers} &
			- Gesture Controllers \newline - Physical Placement of Objects \\
			\hline
			Travel: \newline \textit{Full body tracking} &
			- Fully Body Tracking \newline - 360° Motion Tracking \\

			\hline
		\end{tabular}

	\end{center}
\end{table}

Although no distinct answer can be given to the second \gls{srq}, in combination with the findings from the first /gls{srq} it has been shown where the strengths lie and how they can be utilized. This also shows the close connection between the input method and interaction pattern and that they have to be aligned in order to create an immersive and productive experience.

\section{Data Visualization}

\label{SectionLiteratureReviewSRQ3}

After covering the different methods for user input in \gls{vr} in chapter \ref{SectionLiteratureReviewSRQ1} and the interaction patterns in \gls{vr} in chapter \ref{SectionLiteratureReviewSRQ2}, this chapter concludes the literature research by looking at traditional data visualisation that are used for 2D data and how they have been applied to and enhanced for 3D space in \gls{vr}. After a short introduction to the topic, the two main parts of data visualisation and data manipulation are discussed in more detail, with a focus on the differences between the application in 2D respectively 3D space. Finally, the research covered in this chapter is summarized in the conclusion and will answer the third \gls{srq}.

\subsection{Introduction}

With the invention of (multiple) windows on a computer screen in the late 1960s and the first spreadsheet (VisiCalc) developed in the late 1970s, the era for the visualization of data had just begun \citep{Myers1998}. Although the first \gls{hmd} was already invented in 1960 by Morton Heilig, it was only used for non-interactive film without any motion tracking \citep{vrs2015}. The actual availability for the public of such devices was not possible until the early 1990s although they still were rather expensive or did not fulfil the consumers expectations rendering them a flow (e.g. Nintendo Virtual Boy) \citep{vrs2015}. \cite{Ribarsky1994} highlighted that complicated manipulations of data will be simplified as \gls{vr} can provide a more natural interface between human and computer. He further continues that with \gls{vr} more of our senses are engaged than with regular 2D displays and thus can provide an opportunity to combine them \citep{Ribarsky1994}. \cite{Jamieson2007} further confirm the increased effectiveness and more natural and intuitive view on objects that use a 3D approach as it represents how humans view objects. \newline
\citet[p.411]{Stone1994} emphasized that: \blockquote{Visualization is more of a technique than a task. That is, people don't usually visualize data just for the hell of it.} They further conclude that due to the different goals for the visualization (e.g. testing a theory or understanding the data set), it makes it difficult on a general level to discuss the problems with how the visualization should be supported \citep{Stone1994}. This highlights the importance of the right type of visualization depending on the data itself and the goal that shall be reached. For a better understanding, the following chapter will focus on different approaches and techniques for the presentation of data.

%	SUBSECTION 2

\subsection{Data Presentation}

When we talk about the presentation of data, many will immediately think of Microsoft Excel and the many different charts (e.g. bar chart, line chart, pie chart, scatter plot etc.) that can be created with just a few clicks based on almost any data set. But not only in such mass consumer products, also big \gls{bi} solutions like \cite{TableauSoftware2016} rely on these well known and widely accepted techniques for their visualization of (big) data. \newline



TODO: Data presentation


On a given trial the subject viewed a randomly laid out network of nodes and arcs with two nodes highlighted. The task was to say if there was a path between the the highlighted nodes, while in fact there was either a path of length two or no path, each occurring 50\% of the time. [...]
On the basis of these results we conclude that the graph that can be understood with head coupled stereo is about 3.0 times as large as the 2D graph for any given error rate (taking the ratios of the gradients).
\cite{Ware1994}

Major advances in high performance computing software and hardware have made it possible for designers and analysts to obtain detailed information about the behavior of complex systems. However, this has lead to a proliferation of vast amounts of data which is beyond the ability of humans to easily comprehend using traditional visualization methods.
\cite{Sarathy2000}

As Terabyte datasets become the norm, the focus has shifted away from our ability to produce and store ever larger amounts of data, onto its utilization. It is becoming increasingly difficult to gain meaningful insights into the data produced. Also many forms of the data we are currently producing cannot easily fit into traditional visualization methods.
\cite{Jamieson2007}

Visualization is the main bridge between the quantitative content of the data and human intuition, and it can be argued that we cannot really understand or intuitively comprehend anything (including mathematical constructs) that we cannot visualize in some way.
\cite{Donalek2014}

Van Dam et al. detail similar applications and argue that VR offers substantial advantages for nonhuman- scale visualization, particularly for data that should be explored in multiple time and space scales [7]. These functions are especially challenging for user interface design, the authors point out, but VR has the potential to display a larger quantity of meaningful data and facilitate more natural interaction than traditional 2D visualization techniques.
\cite{Drouhard2015}
From a user interface perspective, perhaps the greatest challenges and rewards lie in the use of IVR for non- human-scale scientific visualization. The need to handle enormous quantities of data, visualize abstract relation- ships, display size ranges from atomic to cosmic, slow down/speed up/stop multidimensional data flows, or interact with inaccessible areas such as the interior of an artery provides challenges not only for visualization but also for the interaction devices and mechanisms.
\cite{VanDam2002}

In a 2D environment (such as a monitor), it makes sense to arrange a scene in a 2D space. But in a virtual reality environment, the user’s location is the focal point of the scene, and there is freedom in the user’s view direction, as the entire sphere of directionality around that point is available. Visibility of the scene from the perspective of the user’s location is vital, so our approach takes advantage of this freedom by using graph layouts on the surface of a sphere, so that all nodes are equally visible to the user. In order to not occlude nodes, edges are routed outside the sphere along more distant control points in a bundled fashion.
\cite{Kwon2015}

\subsubsection{Charts}

TODO: barchart, line-chart, pie-chart
TODO: advancement: rings with different speeds and colour?
\cite{CodeScience2015}

VR is a discipline that enables users to view large complex data sets in an intuitive and natural manner. For example it is possible to represent a particular data value as a 3D object (e.g. the size of a box can represent a parameter value within a dataset).
\cite{Jamieson2007}

Information visualization has relied on traditional methods, namely data mining techniques. [...] This data is usually visualized using 2D graphs, spread sheets, or quasi-3D structures but using a 2D medium (e.g. desktop monitor or projector). The ability to interact with the data is an advantage that data mining techniques does not easily fulfil, also there is a lack of feedback to the user, in timescales that could be considered useful. [...] Furthermore these methods do not scale well to the large multi-dimensional data sets. New methods are required that utilise the advantages of new technology (e.g. VR).
\cite{Jamieson2007}

In general, our visualization approach relies on multiple linked three-dimensional scatterplots which are presented and interacted with in a virtual environment, as shown in Figure 1. Each plot shows an arbitrary combination of three data attributes which are recorded per grid point. Time-dependent data is handled by animating the plots. All scatterplots are linked to each other, i.e., updates to a single plot become directly visible in all plots. This concept of linked views is combined with interactive brushing.

Data with dimensionalities higher than three can be visualized by using multiple characteristics of the virtual objects. Examples include
Size (e.g. large, medium, small)
Shape (e.g. triangle, square, pentagon)
Color (e.g. red, purple, blue)
Texture (photographic images can be "painted" onto objects)
Position (X, Y, and Z)
Orientation (roll, pitch, yaw)
Behavior (spinning, bouncing, blinking, breathing, etc.)
Sound (chiming, singing, buzzing, etc.)
\cite{Stone1994}

Using our approach up to eight different parameters can be visualized by any one data tree. This number can be achieved by matching the physical properties of the tree (i.e. trunk and crown) to different parameters within the data set. The eight different parameters are listed below,
• position of the tree within the VE • height of trunk • width of trunk • colour of trunk • transparency value of the trunk • size of crown • colour of crown • transparency value of crown
\cite{Jamieson2007}

Stock Market Data: Therefore it is possible to match the movement of share prices with the changing shape/growth of the forest. An example of this can be seen in Figure 5.
\cite{Jamieson2007}

A dynamic forest will allow for the use of time variant information. A data tree has been chosen due to the fact that it is a simple object that people are familiar with. People can relate to making decisions on the size and shape of a tree relative to another.

SphereViz interface: The 3D interface is designed for virtual reality (VR) environments. It presents a collection of image thumbnails in a virtual sphere as outlined in Figure 1. The position of a thumbnail in the sphere is determined by a number of parameters. These parameters either describe image properties such as total intensity, color proportions, etc, or characterize the image content.

SphereViz benefits from the advanced spatial visualisation and interaction methods provided by Virtual Reality. Spatial visualisation allows presenting clusters of images in a very user friendly way, spatial interaction is used for evaluation and searching tasks. VR increases the legibility of large datasets and provides more intuitive techniques for browsing through the data.
\cite{Soldati2007}

Visualized data objects are characterized by three attributes: size, scale, and distance. They play an important role for a better understanding of the displayed data in particular because the objects are perceived in "natural scale".

\subsection{Data Manipulation}

TODO: Data manipulation
TODO: Rename to something like "Work with data"?

"Direct Manipulation of Graphical Objects" since 1960 in University Research, since 1970 in Corporate Research and since 1980 in Commercial Products.
\cite{Myers1998}

A visualization goal is to simplify the analysis of large-quantity, numerical data by rendering the data as an image that can be intuitively manipulated.
\cite{Stone1994}

I see VRs as having three important characteristics: First, VRs exhibit high interactivity - there is a tight coupling between the user's actions and the feedback generated by those actions. Second, they support embodiment: some sort of representation of the user is in the same spatial framework as the data. Third, the VR representation is spatial in nature; virtual objects are situated in a spatial framework
\cite{Stone1994}

Second, visualization is entwined with manipulation. We don't just want to look at data, we want to move around it, twist it, shake it, change its color mapping, expand it, rotate it, shrink it, or slice and dice it.
\cite{Stone1994}

VR allows us to create Virtual Environments (VEs) in which we can render our 3D objects representing our data. The advantage that these VEs have over traditional approaches is that they allows us to be immersed within the data. We can use methods to examine the different features of the data that are more intuitive to us. An example of this is the ability to track the users head position so that we can appear to look around object, this is how as humans we are familiar with examining objects of interest, rather than moving a mouse. In a totally immersive virtual environment we can use body movement to walk around objects or put our head inside virtual representation of our data. Also within an immersive environment it is possible to map the users hand position in the real world to a virtual hand in the VE, therefore allowing the user to manipulate virtual objects.
\cite{Jamieson2007}

“Drilling down” is a common term in mentioned in data mining techniques, but here we have taken the approach of “exposing the roots” of the data tree. Users can choose a particular tree that they are interested in by using their input device to “touch” the tree, then using a 3D menu (see Figure 3) choose to further examine the related data.
\cite{Jamieson2007}

From an interaction point of view, the user can now walk through the virtual world and inspect groups of
thumbnails or magnify single thumbnails. Additionally he or she can grab the parameter handles and move them freely on the sphere surface. This will cause the thumbnails to be re-arranged in real-time. This visible movement gives valuable feedback to the user.
\cite{Soldati2007}

Users can freely walk in the virtual world and interact with virtual data objects. They can control the visualization by natural actions like grabbing or moving objects. Thumbnails that are covered by an other object can be brought
to the foreground just by walking around the object. Thus, the user can focus on his or her main task, without bothering about input devices.
\cite{Soldati2007}

The World in Miniature (WIM) is an interface technique that uses a virtual hand-held miniature copy of the immersive virtual scene for visualization and interaction tasks. In addition to the first-person perspective offered by a virtual environment, WIM offers a second dynamic perspective onto the scene. Objects can be manipulated directly in the immersive scene or through the WIM.
\cite{Soldati2007}

We see a great potential in using VR for visual exploration of multi-dimensional data sets and in particular in SphereViz. Amongst others driven by the game industry, we expect VR technology to evolve significantly within the next 10 to 15 years. VR will allow users to look at and interact with large datasets in new ways.
\cite{Soldati2007}

Taking the Visual Information-Seeking Mantra into account [9] the current application covers the zoom and filter and the details on demand part. In future versions we plan to extend the WIM to give the overview of all available data.
\cite{Soldati2007}

The analysis of time-dependent simulation data is a demanding task, both in terms of computing power and time. Interactive analysis using multiple linked views has been shown to be one possible solution to this problem. However, there are two significant short- comings when limited to a standard desktop-based setup: First, complex spatial relationships are hard to understand using only 2D projections of the data. [...]
\cite{Hentschel2009}

Traditionally, researchers look at 3D volume renderings on desktop computer monitors or larger displays, which lack the more realistic visual stimuli found in more advanced displays, such as stereoscopic 3D graphics and motion parallax due to head tracking. Thus, it may be more difficult for the user to judge the size, shape, or depth of the structures in the volume data. Judgments of this sort are required not only for general understanding, but also for performing interactive tasks such as segmentation of a dataset. Conducting such tasks with traditional displays, therefore, may result in slower performance and/or erroneous interpretation.
\cite{Laha2012}

We conducted a controlled empirical study in which we studied the independent and combined effects of three components of immersion (head tracking, FOR, and stereoscopic rendering) on the analysis of two different volume-visualized microscopic computed tomography (micro-CT) datasets. We found significant positive effects of these components of immersion, but the results also show that the effects are dependent on how the components are combined and on the type of analysis task.
\cite{Laha2012}

We found that most of the benefits of high immersion for analyzing volume data are positive. Of the three components of immersion that we evaluated in our controlled study, FOR had the most positive effects on the widest range of tasks. However, levels of immersion have differential effects on different tasks. We observed the most positive effects of immersion for tasks involving visually and spatially complex search for features in the volume datasets. General descriptive tasks showed mixed effects of immersion. Users showed mixed preferences for the different levels of immersion. They felt that stereoscopic vision made it easier to understand features of a volume dataset, and head-based rendering provided greater ease of obtaining the desired view they wanted and of exploring the datasets in general.

VR has been shown to lead to better discovery in domains that whose primary dimensions are spatial.

In this project, our objective is to lower the barriers to entry for exploratory analysis of complex scientific data by leveraging the Oculus Rift to provide intuitive interactions and efficient navigation in an immersive 3D environment
\cite{Drouhard2015}

There are clear advantages to conventional two-dimensional (2D) techniques, such as the bar chart and the scatterplot. The most powerful pattern-finding mechanisms of the brain work in 2D, not 3D. Designers already know how to draw diagrams and represent data effectively in two dimensions, and the results can easily be included in books and reports. Of course, one compelling reason for an interest in 3D space perception is the explosive advance in 3D computer graphics.
\cite{Ware2012}

We still lack design rules for 3D environments, and many interaction techniques are competing for adoption. The strongest argument for the ultimate ascendancy of 3D visualization systems, and 3D user interfaces in general, must be that we live in a 3D world and our brains have evolved to recognize and interact within 3D. The 3D design space is richer than the 2D design space, because a 2D space is a part of 3D space. It is always possible to flatten out part of a 3D display and represent it in 2D.
\cite{Ware2012}

Nevertheless, it also should be cautioned that going from 2D to 3D adds far less visual information than might be supposed. Consider the following simple argument. On a one-dimensional line of a computer display, we can perceive 1000 distinct pixels. On a 2D plane of the same display, we can display 1000 × 1000 = 1,000,000 pixels, but going to a 3D stereoscopic display only increases the number of pixels by a factor of 2, and this does not double the available information because the two images must be highly correlated for us to perceive stereoscopic depth.
\cite{Ware2012}

They examine how traditional methods for 2D User interface/User Experience usability evaluation may be applied to VR interfaces. They also discuss subjective measures that should be used to assess VR applications, including user comfort and ease of use. --> 12 (Bowman2012a)
\cite{Drouhard2015}

In the case of scientific analysis, the transition to a 3D environment can be difficult, as most scientists typically explore their data using 2D visualizations, and they have been doing so for decades. Careful thought should be devoted to ways to capture the essence of the most effective 2D interactions and bring them to bear in a 3D display.

brainstorming
- click to select/highlight/focus   --> click with controller
- click+drag to re-order / rotate	--> re-order remains the same, rotate by walking (!!)
- click+drag to select area to zoom   --> walking closer, maybe select range with controllers
- mouse-wheel to zoom in/out   --> zoom by walking closer (!!)
- right-lick for context menu (add, remove, ...)   --> click with controller
- enable/disable with checkboxes

currently primarily done with mouse which can be 1:1 substituted with a gesture controller
BUT use 3d space to utilize walking option
